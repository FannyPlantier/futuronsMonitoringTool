# futurons monitoring tool
Creation of a specific monitoring tool for an association, which also allows the creation of collections and relationships between data.

One of the specific requests of the association is to create a Jamstack application where the front-end and back-end are completely dissociated and communicate primarily through APIs.
After discussing the purpose of the project and establishing the needs, I will create a use case diagram, define the data model, and finally develop the entire application.
